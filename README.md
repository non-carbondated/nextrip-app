# NexTrip App

The purpose of this project is to use the Twin Cities  Metro Transit [NexTrip API](https://svc.metrotransit.org/swagger/index.html) to create a web application that provides the following functionality:

**Displaying real time departures by route**
- Selecting a route from a list of active routes
- Selecting a direction from a list of directions for the selected route
- Selecting a stop from a list of available stops for the selected route and direction
- Refresh the departure data every 30 seconds

**Displaying real time departures by stop number**
- Alert the user when an entered stop number doesn't exist
- Refresh the departure data every 30 seconds

## Assumptions made
- Route, direction and stop API endpoints are trusted to be up
- Route, direction and stop response data has accurate data
- A request for departures using an invalid stop number will respond with a 400 error and a response detail property of 'Invalid Stop ID'
- Departure data should be refreshed every 30 seconds
- Departure data that is actually being sent from the vehicle should be signified as different from other scheduled departures
- Component tests assert the desired user experience and not implementation details
- App should be be used on phone devices and larger (built with responsive web design in mind)
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
